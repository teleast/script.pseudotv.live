Installation instructions.

Inside the 1080i folder you'll find the following files:

1. DialogSeekBar - Overwrite the older version of this file in the 720p/1080i folder of whatever skin you happen to use. 

2. EPGWindow/Overlay - Overwrite the older version of these files in the LIB folder within PseudoTV live.

3. Fonts - Open this file up and paste the contents into the Font file within the 720p/1080i folder of whatever skin you use. Do not 		           simply overwrite your Font file!!! Doing so would break your skin.

Other Folders included:

4. Channel Numbers - paste these 10 files in the IMAGES folder of PTVL, overwriting the previous versions.

5. Fonts - paste the contents of this folder into the Fonts folder for whatever skin you happen to use.

Inside the Channel Logo folder you'll find a .PSD file called "CHANNEL TEMPLATE." If you want to create channels to match the ones I have included, it's pretty easy. 

1. You will see a layer called "Pseudo-Theater." I use this for movie channels. If you are creating a TV channel then deselect the layer      to hide it. 

2. There is a layer called "Logo size guide." I use this as a cheat sheet when creating a new logo. Just line up your new logo with the    included Animax logo and it'll fit perfectly within the Overlay and EPG.
   
3. The three effects I use for all my colored channel logos are Stroke, Gradient Overlay, and Drop Shadow. All the settings for each of    the effects are set to be the defaults so you should have no problem matching the ones already included. Oh and obviously for the White    versions of each channel logo just exclude gradient overlay.

4. I figured I'd write up a real quick explaination on how I set up my library content channels. Since with PTVL we now have "Real" cable     channels like CBS, NBC, ABC, etc. I didn't think it made sense to also make "Fake" versions of those channels -- also I just like          grouping my content by genres...so anyway, here's how I set up "Fake" library based channels and the logos that correspond with each.
